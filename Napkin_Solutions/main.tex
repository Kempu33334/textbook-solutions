\begin{problem}[1.A]
What is the joke in this: ``Baby, my love for you has a proper subgroup isomorphic to itself.''
\end{problem}
A proper subgroup can only be isomorphic to itself if has infinite order. Hence, the joke is that ``Baby, my love for you is infinite''.

\begin{problem}[1.B]
Prove Lagrange's theorem for orders in the special case that $G$ is a finite abelian group.
\end{problem}
We show that \[x^{|G|} = 1_G\] if $x \in G$. Consider taking $\prod_{i=1}^{|G|}G_i$. Notice that a multiplication by $x$ simply reorders the elements of $G$. Hence, \[\prod_{i=1}^{|G|}(xG_i) = x^{|G|}\prod_{i=1}^{|G|}G_i = \prod_{i=1}^{|G|}G_i\] since $G$ is abelian. Thus, we find that \[x^{|G|} = 1_G\] as required. $\square$

\begin{problem}[1.C]
Show that $D_6 \cong S_3$ but $D_{24} \ncong S_4$.
\end{problem}
Clearly, $|D_6| = |S_3| = 6$. Consider labeling the vertices of a regular triangle with $1$, $2$, and $3$ (arbitrarily). Any operation in $D_6$ simply reorders the vertices (and thus their labels) in a unique way. Hence, there exists a one-to-one mapping from $D_6$ to $S_3$, so they are isomorphic.

On the other hand, $D_{24}$ has elements of order $12$, while $S_4$ does not have elements of order $12$, so $D_{24} \ncong S_4$.
